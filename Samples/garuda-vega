Venu (Harish) is the guy that every mother warns their daughter about. He doesn’t visit his ailing mother (Eswari Rao), who is paralysed; and is a nightmare to the residents of the apartment he stays in.

Bhanumathi (Avantika) is on the lookout for a suitable facility to start a beauty salon and finds Venu’s apartment apt to set up her business. Much to the viewers’ expectations, a cat and mouse chase ensues and lead pair ends up falling in love.

The first half of the film has been stretched to only establish the love story between the two, with little novelty on offer. Respite from the mundane love track comes in the form of songs, which showcase Harish’s impressive moves.

Only after the intermission does the real story start to unravel, and the pace is reasonably fast too. Director B Jaya wanted Vaisakham to draw crowds for its romantic appeal that was depicted through the promotional material, but the film has more to offer than just the love story. The emphasis is more on human relationships in general.

The film scores in terms of music, set-up and visuals. However, it has nothing compelling to write home about. Watch it if you want to enjoy the songs on the big screen.
