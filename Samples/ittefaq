With cops on his tail for being charged with his wife's murder, Vikram Sethi (Sidharth Malhotra) runs into Maya (Sonakshi Sinha) and manages to get refuge in her house on a rainy Mumbai night. Maya soon learns that Vikram could be a convict on the run so she alerts the cops, who nab Vikram and discover the dead body of her husband Shekhar in the house. Maya accuses Vikram of double murder but Vikram pleads innocence. The case is assigned to officer Dev (Akshaye Khanna), who must decode the mystery in three days.

An adaptation of Yash Chopra's 1969 suspense drama, starring Rajesh Khanna and Nanda, Abhay Chopra retains the theme of the original and infuses his own twists and turns to the story, which keeps you intrigued. While his efforts are sincere and understated, there's a lot that gets lost in translation.

Unlike the linear storytelling of the original, this investigative reboot gets a bit tedious as it simultaneously presents two parallel accounts of Maya and Vikram as they reveal their respective versions of the story to Dev. What makes it further complicated is the fact that the two suspects tell their tale in instalments. This results in constant flashbacks.

Eventually, this trick of shuttling between past and present to elevate the suspense quotient backfires as it obstructs your train of thought and doesn't allow fear or tension to creep in.

However, one person who salvages this whodunit, single-handedly and makes it worth a watch is Akshaye Khanna. He lends gravitas to the otherwise dreary proceedings. His banter with fellow cop (Mr Tambe) is hilarious. On the contrary, Sidharth's deadpan expressions and Sonakshi's limited character arc, disappoint.

Overall, Ittefaq may not be a taut thriller that you expect it to be. But if patience is your asset, this unhurried suspense drama can be watched for Akshaye Khanna's crackling screen presence, acting prowess and sublime charm. Why he doesn't do films more often is the bigger mystery here.
